1)How is Java platform-independent?
ANS)When we compile Java code, it is converted into bytecode (.class files`), not native machine code.
    This bytecode is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which converts it into machine code at runtime using its interpreter and JIT compiler. 
    Each operating system has its own JVM implementation, which makes Java platform-independent
